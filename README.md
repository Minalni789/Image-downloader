This is one of my very first projects using java script. I used it to learn how to access API, and how Chrome extensions are bult.
It's a lightweight and user-friendly web browser extension designed to simplify the process of downloading images from web pages in bulk.
The extension enhances user browsing experience by providing a convenient way to download all images with a single click. When button "Download all" 
in extension popup is clocked, the downloading of all images on a webpage starts Immediately.
